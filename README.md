## Welcome! 

My name is Matt.  I'm into software, people, cooperatives of all kinds, cooking, and music.  Here's what I'm up to these days - <a href="https://mattg.xyz">mattg.xyz</a>

I'm currently a software engineer at <a href="https://www.izotope.com/">iZotope</a>. 

In the beginning of the covid19 pandemic, I created a simple collaborative DAW web app called <a href=https://github.com/mgoldfield/nodelooper>LoopMagic</a> to allow musicians to collaborate while we were separated from each other.  Thanks to all the folks who used it, but sadly I took it down when I didn't have enough time to maintain it.  I hope to get it back running someday!
