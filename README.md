## Welcome! 

My name is Matt.  I'm into software, people, cooperatives of all kinds, cooking, and music.  

<br/>
I'm currently a software engineer at <a href="https://www.izotope.com/">iZotope</a>. I'm an emeritus member of <a href="https://www.politicsrewired.com/">Politics Rewired</a>, a visionary organizing and software cooperative! 
<br/><br/>


In the beginning of the covid19 pandemic, I created a simple collaborative DAW web app called <a href=https://github.com/mgoldfield/nodelooper>LoopMagic</a> to allow musicians to collaborate while we were separated from each other.  Thanks to all the folks who used it, but sadly I took it down when I didn't have enough time to maintain it.  I hope to get it back running someday!  

Here's <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qe7b7juec3525xw/Software%20Engineering%20%2723.pdf?dl=0">what I've been up</a> to in the software world for a while.
